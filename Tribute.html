        <h2 id="arteezy">Arteezy</h2>
        <p>Artour Babaev, better known as Arteezy, is a Canadian professional Dota 2 player for Shopify Rebellion. He is also one of the most popular streamers among the community. Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Babaev showed much promise as a child, reaching the highest matchmaking rating on the leaderboards in public matches. In November 2013, he made his professional debut in MLG Columbus as a stand-in for Speed Gaming. In January 2014, Babaev, along with North American Dota players Universe and Fear, as well as former Heroes of Newerth players ppd and zai created "S A D B O Y S" , who were later signed by Evil Geniuses. He has also streamed on Twitch since 2014.</p>
        <h2 id="history">History<h2>
          <h3>2013: Early career</h3>
        <p>
Arteezy convincingly outperformed several established midlane players, such as Mushi and Dendi, on his way to securing an unexpected triumph for Speed Gaming against the star-studded Team DK in the finals.</p>
        <h3 class="no-margin">2014: Birth of Evil Geniuses</h3>
        <p>Evil Geniuses received a direct invitation to The International 2014 Dota 2 Championships due to their impressive top 3 finishes at three major LAN events, including a first-place victory at The Summit 1 against Team DK. While they weren't as adept as Chinese Dota 2 teams in adjusting to the more aggressive playstyle at TI4, EG still secured a respectable 3rd-place finish, earning them $1,038,416 in prize money.</p>
       
        <h3 class="no-margin">2015: Joined Team Secret</h3>
        <p>
In December 2014, Arteezy departed from the squad and became a member of Team Secret. As Arteezy assumed the carry role, Team Secret dominated The Summit 3, Mars Dota League 2015, and ESL One Frankfurt 2015, clinching first place in each event and solidifying their status as frontrunners for The International 2015. However, Team Secret's journey at TI5 concluded with a 7–8th place finish.</p>
        <h3 class="no-margin">2016: Highest ranked playe</h3>
        <p>
In July 2016, Arteezy achieved the remarkable feat of becoming the second Dota 2 player ever to attain a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) of 9,000 in online matchmaking. The initial player to accomplish this milestone was Miracle-, a member of Team Liquid.</p>
        <h3 class="no-margin">2017: The Manila Masters champion</h3>
        <p>Evil Geniuses secured the top spot at The Manila Masters, earning them $125,000. However, their performance at The International 2017, where they were directly invited, resulted in a 9th-12th place finish. This led to the departure of Zai, the position 4 player, who was replaced by their former coach, Fear. As of October 9, Arteezy remains an active member of the team, playing as the carry.</p>
        <h3 class="no-margin">2018: The International 2018</h3>
        <p>On July 27, 2018, Evil Geniuses emerged victorious in the North American in-house tournament Summit 9, hosted by Beyond The Summit. In August of the same year, Arteezy and his team secured a third-place finish at The International 2018, marking his second 3rd-place finish at the tournament and his best overall performance.</p>
        <h3 class="no-margin">2019: The International 2019
</h3>
        <p>In August 2019, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses finished 5th-6th at The International 2019. Arteezy made a remarkable performance, getting a solo rampage versus 5 enemies on his game with Evil Geniuses against Vici Gaming.</p>
         <h3 class="no-margin">2021: The International 2021</h3>
        <p>In October 2021, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses achieved a 9th-12th place finish at The International 2021, receiving $800,400</p>
         <h3 class="no-margin">2022: The International 2022</h3>
        <p>In October 2022, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses finished 9th-12th place at The International 2022. On November 15, 2022, it was announced that Evil Geniuses would be dropping their current Dota 2 roster. On December 9, 2022, Arteezy joined Shopify Rebellion.</p>
